### LLM Demos

A place to explore some work with LLMs.

Start with [this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_pres_county.csv).


1. The site works as is. I actually really like the boxing around the general information but the rest of it feels a little dull, not very visually appealing. But in terms of functionality, it works. 
2. I changed the pie chart to a bar chart to make it a bit more visually representative. I prompted Claude to change the chart type and it chose the bar chart (which I was hoping it would). But could not give me the right code order the percentages in the chart and grid when I would switch counties. I reached my message limit before I could help it fix the ordering. 
3. Other than elections, I think a news organization could use this sort of technique to make handle data like demographic statistics of counties or even states, it could help make interactive graphics for data stories (which I think might be easier to do in Flourish or Datawrapper). I think this would work if it is a very small newsroom with very specific html/coding for their website or that cannot take the time to analyze, interpret and visualize the data and would benefit from AI doing this for them.
